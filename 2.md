Merkle Trees (Hash Tree) :
* Binary Merkle Tree :
      A (Hroot)
     / \
    B   C (H0,H1)
   / \  / \
  D  E  F  G (H00,H01,H10,H11)

  * Maximum of Child Nodes is 2

* Adv of merkle tree ; can collectively secure multiple documents as change in any one reflects in root hash.

* Complexity : Number of zeroes in hash given a nonce (value).

* Hk = Hk-1 || T ||Nonce
            |--->No of Transactions

* Longest Chain is the chain to which new blocks are added. If same lengths, random chain selected.

  * If user recives multiple blockchains, then longest chain is added.

* Orphaned Blocks : Not part of longest chain
