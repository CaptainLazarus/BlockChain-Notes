* 3 imp properties of a hash function

  * Digest for different messages mmust be different.
    * i.e Collision Free

  * One way hash : Given H(M) cannot compute M efficiently. Allows for hiding.

  * Puzzle Friendly: Y = H(X||k)

    * Given X and Y, we cannot find k efficiently. We can only solve by random methodology. Used for mining.

* Collision of hash is difficult , not impossible.

* SHA 256 usedduring mining of bitcoin
  * SHA developed by US security agencies
